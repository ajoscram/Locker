## Welcome to Locker!

Locker is a small [open source](https://github.com/ajoscram/Locker) Windows program made to make passwords easier to manage and maintain.

At its core, Locker allows you to create files which store pairs of **keys** and **values** called **fields**, that can be encrypted or decrypted through different algorithms (called **encrypters** in this program). Futhermore, it can be called from the command line to easily retrieve any field you want directly into the Windows clipboard.

Click on any of the other pages in the sidebar to learn more. It is recommended however to start with the [Files page](https://github.com/ajoscram/Locker/wiki/Files) of the wiki. There's not too much stuff there anyway, Locker is fairly straight forward if you've ever used another program.

If you still have any questions after reading, feel free to contact me via email at ajoscram@gmail.com. Thanks for downloading and using Locker! ðŸ”’
